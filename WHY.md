### 📘 Understanding DNS in Simple Words

When you buy a domain (like learnforge.site) from a registrar such as GoDaddy, it’s recorded in a huge global diary called the DNS Registry.
This diary keeps track of who owns each domain and which name servers know where that domain should point.

### 🧠 What Happens Behind the Scenes

You buy a domain → GoDaddy writes your name into the global “domain diary.”
It also notes: “GoDaddy manages the DNS for this domain.”

You create a Hosted Zone in AWS Route 53 → Route 53 gives you four special Name Servers (NS).
These are AWS computers that can answer questions like
“Where should learnforge.site point?”

You update your GoDaddy Nameservers → In GoDaddy’s settings, you replace their NS records with the ones from Route 53.
This tells the global diary:

“From now on, AWS Route 53 manages DNS for learnforge.site.”
```
Someone visits your site →
Their browser asks the internet:
“Where is learnforge.site?”
The global DNS system checks the diary, sees “Route 53,” and forwards the question to AWS.

Route 53 replies →

learnforge.site → GitHub Pages (frontend)

api.learnforge.site → AWS ALB → ECS → RDS (backend)
```
Browser connects → The site loads, all within milliseconds ⚡
(because DNS results are cached by servers worldwide).
```

#### 💡 Why This Matters

You still own your domain in GoDaddy.

But Route 53 now manages where it points.

This allows full control from AWS — including SSL certificates, load balancer mappings, and Terraform automation.
